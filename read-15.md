# Diversity and inclusion

Tech is a (mostly rich, mostly white) boys club and has been for too long. These articles were all written 3 to 5 years ago but unfortunately could still be written today.

The gender gap is something I have seen in previous workplaces. At one of my first jobs there was a tam of three mainframe programmers, the lead was the man in the group even though they all three knew that the two women were the better coders.

At my last job we never had more than two women in our tech support group and most of them didn't last long because many of the customers(and too many of our team) would not take them seriously as technical experts.

We lost out on some good, creative technicians because of that.

What can I do about this? I've never been in a position with enough authority to affect hiring decisions. I'm more representative of the problem. I recognize that as a straight white male I'm given a presumption of competence that is not given to others, how can I use that to allow other voices to be heard when I'm still in the lower levels of an organization?

I don't know what I can do other than make sure to let other voices be heard and ask for their input where I have an opportunity to do so
