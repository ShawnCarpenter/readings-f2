# Components and thinking in react

Bits and pieces, create the smallest piece that works (an atom) and use them to build bigger pieces (molecules), those build bigger pieces (organisms?) shouldn't there be organs in there somewhere? Or am I breaking it down too much? 

Real organisms are made up of linked systems of organs that are made of cells that are made of molecules, that are made of atoms. Not going into sub-atomic particles in this analogy, but if I did would they be the actual bits the computer uses to do its thinking?

React breaks down parts of the program into basic components, useful way of thinking and one I start every project with the full intention of implementing, by the end it becomes 'Get the code down, as long as it works it's OK' I need to get better at it, practice, practice, practice.... 

# Callbact functions

Why did I have trouble with the callback but not with the anonymous function in the code challenge? I'm missing something. Am I not understanding callbacks, or am I not understanding array.forEach?
