# Form styling

General styling, this video covered basic styling of the form itself.

Radio buttons, This was the best explanation of how to use an image sprite to indicate whether or not a radio button is selected I have seen. I have seen other examples but they were not clear to me how they worked.

Checkboxes, similar to radio buttons. Definitely bookmarked this series.

Inputs, this seems so simple when he does it. More to learn...

Select boxes, more background image magic. 

Validation, magic again. I need to look up more on image sprites.
