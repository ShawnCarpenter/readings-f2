# Node

>> Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

Node uses the v8 runtime from Chrome to run Javascript applications on a computer. Usually it's used to develop web application backends but it can also be used to develop desktop applications such as VScode.
