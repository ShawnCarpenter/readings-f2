# SQL
SQL is a language used to describe, manipulate and retreive data. 
SQL databases store information in tables, each table is defined as a series of columns, the data is stored in rows in that column. 

SELECT statements are used to retrieve data

INSERT statements are used to add rows of data

UPDATE statements are used to change values in existing rows of data.


DELETE statements are used to remove data from a table.
Important note from the SQL Bolt exercise:
>>If you decide to leave out the WHERE constraint, then all rows are removed, which is a quick and easy way to clear out a table completely (if intentional).

It's also a quick and hard way to be asked to clear out your desk if it was unintentional. (You had backups right? Are you sure? When was the last time you tried a restore?)

The SQL Bolt exercises were a good refresher, I haven't had to write SQL queries for a few years.

The Cheatsheet was immediately bookmarked.

I've downloaded and skimmed the primer, it seems useful.
