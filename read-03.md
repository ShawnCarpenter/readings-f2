Why use a formula that leads to things like ```margin: 1.858736059%;``` does the extra 0.141263941% really make a difference?

>> Note that this article was published in 2012. Floats was still the primary method for a grid system, and this article focuses on really simple methods for that, like just floating four 25% elements and not getting crazy with math and exotic gutter systems. These days, I’d highly recommend using CSS grid or flexbox for your grid system, if you even need to create an abstracted grid at all. It’s arguably even easier and definitely more flexible and powerful.

Grids and flex are better, I just skimmed this. It's scary, not as bad as table-based layout but yeah, there is a better way.

I don't know if this quote makes me feel attacked or seen.  I definitely can relate.
