# SQL joins and relations

SQL is a relational database, that means that you can relate two tables by using a key field.

An employees table could have id,user name, address, password, and job_id

a jobs table could have an id, title,description, and depaertment.

then you could match the employee to the job by matching the job_id of the employee to the id of the jobs table.

Planning out what data you are goinjg to have and how it relates together is a vital part of developing a relational database application.
